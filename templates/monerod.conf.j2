# Data directory (blockchain db and indices)
data-dir=/home/monero/.bitmonero

# Server general options
no-zmq=1
no-igd=1 # Disable UPnP port mapping
enforce-dns-checkpointing=1 # Emergency checkpoints set by MoneroPulse operators will be enforced to workaround potential consensus bugs
db-sync-mode=safe # Slow but reliable db writes
prune-blockchain=1

# Log file
log-file=/dev/null # Will run inside docker, we don't care about log files
log-level=1 # Increase the log level from the default
max-log-file-size=0

# P2P full node
p2p-bind-ip=0.0.0.0            # Bind to all interfaces (the default)
p2p-bind-port=18080            # Bind to default port
out-peers=64                   # This will enable much faster sync and tx awareness; the default 8 is suboptimal nowadays
in-peers=1024                  # The default is unlimited; we prefer to put a cap on this

# RPC open node
rpc-bind-ip=0.0.0.0            # Bind to all interfaces
